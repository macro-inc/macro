PROJECT DIRECTION

We intend to open-source most of the codebase under a copy-left license in the future, with a separate Enterprise Edition (EE) component. We’re actively exploring the best way to do this while preserving a high-quality commercial product and a sustainable ecosystem.

CONTRIBUTIONS

We’re not accepting external contributions yet.
Feel free to explore the code and follow progress, but please do not submit PRs or attempt to reuse the code at this time.
