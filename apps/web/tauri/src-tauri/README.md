# Tauri / Mobile Frontend

This crate wraps the shared web client that lives in `packages/app`. There is a
single Vite build that runs identically for web, desktop, iOS, and Android — the
platform is detected at runtime via `getPlatform()` rather than baked into the
bundle.

## Running in development

```sh
# Desktop shell (macOS/Linux/Windows)
cargo tauri dev

# iOS simulator
cargo tauri ios dev

# Android emulator
cargo tauri android dev
```

The `beforeDevCommand` is `just dev-tauri`, which runs `bun run dev` against the
single `vite.config.ts`.

You can override the dev server host for devices/emulators by exporting
`TAURI_DEV_HOST` before running `cargo tauri …`.

## Building bundles

```sh
# Desktop bundle
cargo tauri build

# iOS / Android release artifacts
cargo tauri ios build
cargo tauri android build
```

The `beforeBuildCommand` is `just build-tauri`, which runs `bun run build` and
emits the frontend into `packages/app/dist`. Tauri then packages that output
according to `tauri.conf.json`.

## Platform aware UI

Use the helpers in `@core/util/platform` (`isTauri()`, `getPlatform()`,
`isMobilePlatform()`, etc.) anywhere you need to branch behaviour, register
extra routes, or mount native-only UI. Pair those checks with the
`MaybeTauriProvider` from `@macro/tauri` to keep native-specific wiring
localized while rendering everything through the shared `packages/app` entry
point.
