# Entity

App-local entity feature code, including composable entity rendering,
domain-specific extractors, editing surfaces, query and mutation adapters, and
search/notification adapters. The `@entity` alias is the feature's public
app-local entry point.

`ListEntity.referencePropertyIds` opts stored reference properties into the
existing inline metadata area. Names and icons use the shared property preview
cache; the row does not search for related entities. Narrow rows compact these
pills to icons, with full names available in tooltips and the overflow menu.
