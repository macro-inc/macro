# AI Chat (Agents)

## Where chats live

- List: `Go to Agents` → `/app/component/agents`, tabs Owned / Running / Shared /
  Automations / Skills. Existing chats are listed by auto-generated title.
- A chat is `/app/chat/<uuid>`. A doc-scoped chat is `/app/md/<doc>/chat/<chat>` (split view).

## Start a standalone chat

Almost every list surface (Home, Agents, Files, Tasks, Customers, Email) has a bottom
composer with placeholder **`Ask AI, @mention anything`**. Click it, `type_text` the message,
press Enter — the app creates a chat and navigates to `/app/chat/<uuid>`. Alternatively
`Create` → `Coding Agent A`, or keyboard `c` then `a`.

## Start a doc-scoped chat

Open a doc → side panel `Actions` → `Ask Macro`. Opens a chat pane with the document already
attached as context (it appears as a link chip in the composer). New-chat pane shows tips:
`@mention anything` to attach entities, `Ctrl+Enter` to send in the background (you get
notified when the AI responds).

## Composer anatomy (a11y)

- Contenteditable composer (placeholder `Ask AI, @mention anything` / `Describe the edit…`).
- Model picker button showing the current model (e.g. `Haiku 4.5`).
- `Send` button (disabled when empty). While streaming it becomes `Stop generating`.

## Waiting for a response

The reliable completion signal is the disappearance of the `Stop generating` button — poll
with `evaluate_script`. Do not wait on response text: the page displays
`Time to first token: N s` and doc content that easily false-matches `wait_for` patterns.
After completion, each assistant message gets `Edit assistant response in Notes` and
`Copy assistant response` buttons; tool-use turns render as an expandable `N steps` button.
The chat auto-titles itself after the first exchange (route stays stable, title changes).

The agent has workspace tools (it can list your documents, read channels, create tasks,
render `displayResults` views). Requests go to `POST /cognition/stream/chat/message`; results
stream over the app's websocket, not the HTTP response.

## In channels

Mention `@Macro` in any channel message to invoke the agent there.
