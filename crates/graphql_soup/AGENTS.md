# graphql_soup

## What it is

Backs the Soup feature (the app's unified entity search/home surface): the
soup-domain GraphQL wrapper types. The composed schema (root query, viewer,
SDL export) lives in `complete_graph` — see `../complete_graph/AGENTS.md` for
the schema conventions (presence-of-`id` normalized-cache rules and the
viewer pattern), which apply to every type defined here.
